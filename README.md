# Hierarchical-Identification-of-bats-using-their-call-acoustics

Tracing the biological hierarchy and narrowing down to the identification of the species of bats remain a historically challenging and dynamic topic of research in the domain of biology. Capturing the attention of the enthusiasts, the traces of research in this study involves the critical analysis of the most prominent trait of the bats – their calls – which is further blended with the concepts of Machine Learning and viewed as a supervised learning problem with the acoustic decomposition of the bat calls as the features. However, with the emergence of Deep Learning, the exploration of this multi-class classification problem in the context of Neural Networks is yet unexplored. Exploring through the lens of Deep Learning, the objective of this study revolves around the hierarchical classification of the family, genus, and species of bats using deep neural networks, taking the acoustic components of the bat calls as the input and simultaneously compare the model performances to the previously implemented counterparts. Delving into the nuances of deep learning in the context of this data, the study also attempts to break into the black-box mechanism of neural networks to explore the yet unexplored feature importance and feature ranking approaches. Finally, I took a little detour to explore another fascinating aspect of this study which investigates the association of the geographical location of the recorded bat call with its acoustic components. This is believed to be extremely beneficial for the biologists in identifying the geographic region in which a particular call was recorded, which may provide answers to a plethora of unanswered questions on the locational characteristics of the species.
